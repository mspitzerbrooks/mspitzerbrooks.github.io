Excerpts from student evaluations:
- "I appreciated how this TA taught concepts in a manner that made the material understandable. I like how he used analogies to teach concepts, which made the material more easier to digest."
- "Matthew was constantly making sure we understood the problem solving process and gave us valuable time to ask questions and engage with the material."
- "...discussions were very clear and [I] really enjoyed them as they helped me understand the class the best"
- "Helped deepen my understanding of some topics we went over class"
- "Matthew is really clear with the way he explains things"
- "...he is extremely helpful. He would explain everything in depth and wouldn't move onto the next topic until everyone was on board. I really like his teaching style as well."
- "I appreciate how discussion was able to teach me specific methods of doing problems which lecture never did."
