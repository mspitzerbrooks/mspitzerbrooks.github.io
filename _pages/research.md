    <p>We conduct an experiment with online workers to assess whether the distortionary effect of a tax is sensitive to the ideological match between taxpayer and tax expenditures. We find that, among self-identified political moderates, the labor supply elasticity with respect to the net of tax wage is significantly smaller when individuals pay taxes to a favored government agency as compared to an unfavored one. While the tax has a significant distortionary effect in the latter case, with a point estimate for the labor supply elasticity of approximately 0.77, the elasticity point estimate is close to zero when taxes go to a favored agency. There is also an increase in total output for the matched population among moderates. There is no evidence that these effects hold for self-identified liberals or conservatives.</p>

* The Pollution–Productivity Curve: Non-linear Effects and Adaptation in High-pollution Environments (with Faraz Usmani) *Draft available upon request*

    <summary><small><strong>Show Abstract</strong></small></summary>
    <p>Air pollution harms labor productivity, yet little is known about whether workers adapt to chronic exposure. We address this question using 14 years of individual-level performance data from India's premier cricket league, a setting characterized by some of the highest levels of particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and whose schedule and geography result in variation in both acute and chronic exposure histories. We pair these granular performance metrics with an India-specific machine learning data product that incorporates remotely sensed and ground-monitor measures of PM2.5. Our results reveal that both chronic and acute exposure to pollution are costly, but in different ways. A 10 microgram-per-cubic-meter increase in same-day PM2.5 concentration (half a standard deviation in our sample) reduces productivity by about 1 percent, with effects concentrated at the highest pollution levels, implying a nonlinear dose-response. The dose-response also exhibits surprising heterogeneity: same-day shocks harm those chronically exposed at the highest levels approximately 40 percent less than those with median exposure histories, indicating adaptation. Nevertheless, chronic exposure itself results in performance declines that, though smaller in magnitude than the declines resulting from same-day shocks, far outweigh any protective effect from adaptation. Our findings suggest that standard estimates from low-pollution environments do not capture the dynamics between acute and chronic exposure in high-pollution settings.</p>
