Welcome to my website! I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of environmental and development economics. My job market paper examines how the effect of air pollution on labor productivity varies by past exposure to air pollution, with implications for environmental regulation in developing economies where chronic exposure is widespread. Broadly, my research agenda focuses on the role of market failures such as environmental externalities and imperfect information in economic development. My undergraduate studies were in Economics and Religion (with a focus on Buddhist Philosophy) at Middlebury College.
