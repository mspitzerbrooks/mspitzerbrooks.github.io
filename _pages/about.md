Welcome to my website! I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at University of California, Davis. My fields are development economics and environmental economics. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at Mathematica Policy Research as a Research Analyst for several years. I have also worked on research projects at the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics in Kenya. My undergraduate studies were in Economics and Religion (with a focus on Buddhist Philosophy) at Middlebury College.
