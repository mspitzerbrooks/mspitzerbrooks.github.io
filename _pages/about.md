Welcome to my website! I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of environmental and development economics. My job market paper examines how the effect of air pollution on labor productivity varies by past exposure to air pollution, with implications for environmental regulation in developing economies where chronic exposure is widespread. Broadly, my research agenda focuses on the role of market failures such as environmental externalities and imperfect information in economic development. 

My undergraduate studies were in Economics and Religion (with a focus on Buddhist Philosophy) at Middlebury College. In addition to research, teaching is integral to my scholarship. I enjoy inspiring students to see how economics can provide useful tools and models for quantifying and analyzing complex phenomena.

    <summary><strong>Show Abstract</strong></summary>
    <p>Air pollution harms labor productivity, yet little is known about whether workers adapt to chronic exposure. We address this question using performance data from India's premier cricket league, which provides exogenous variation in both acute pollution exposure and long-term exposure histories. We find that a 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in PM2.5 (equivalent to one-half of a standard deviation in our sample) reduces productivity by about 1 percent, with effects concentrated at extreme pollution levels that far exceed WHO guidelines. However, workers appear to adapt: those with the highest levels of chronic exposure show a dramatically smaller response to acute pollution episodes, with the most chronically exposed experiencing approximately 40 percent smaller productivity losses than those with median exposure histories. Our findings suggest that standard estimates from low-pollution environments poorly capture the dynamics between short- and long-term exposure in high-pollution settings, with important implications for environmental regulation in developing economies where chronic exposure is widespread.</p>
