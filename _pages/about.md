Welcome to my website! I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of environmental and development economics. My research focuses on the role of market failures such as environmental externalities and information frictions in economic development.

My undergraduate studies were in Economics and Religion (with a focus on Buddhist Philosophy) at Middlebury College. In addition to research, I enjoy inspiring students to see how economics can provide useful tools and models for quantifying and analyzing complex phenomena.

## Research in Progress

* The Pollution–Productivity Curve: Non-linear Effects and Adaptation in High-pollution Environments (with Faraz Usmani) *Draft available upon request*

    <summary><small><strong>Show Abstract</strong></small></summary>
    <p>Air pollution harms labor productivity, yet little is known about whether workers adapt to chronic exposure. We address this question using 14 years of individual-level performance data from India's premier cricket league, a setting characterized by some of the highest levels of particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and whose schedule and geography result in variation in both acute and chronic exposure histories. We pair these granular performance metrics with an India-specific machine learning data product that incorporates remotely sensed and ground monitor measures of PM2.5. Our findings suggest that both chronic and acute exposure to pollution are costly, but in different ways. A 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in same-day PM2.5 concentration (half a standard deviation in our sample) reduces productivity by about 1 percent, with effects concentrated at the highest pollution levels, indicating a nonlinear dose-response. The dose-response also exhibits surprising heterogeneity: same-day shocks harm those chronically exposed at the highest levels approximately 40 percent less than those with median exposure histories, indicating adaptation. Nevertheless, chronic exposure itself results in performance declines which, though smaller in magnitude than the declines resulting from same-day shocks, far outweigh any protective effect from adaptation. Our findings suggest that standard estimates from low-pollution environments do not capture the dynamics between acute and chronic exposure in high-pollution settings.</p>
